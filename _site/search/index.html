Fast The website should be fast to load and should help users find information quickly. Consistent The website should have consistent navigation, language, layout and visual styling Appropriate The website should have an appropriate tone, style, language, and visual design for its intended audience(s) Providing feedback The website should provide feedback to the user, informing them about the system status, any needed actions from the user's part, and provide help. Most of these principles can be achieved through writing good content, retaining a logical, shallow navigation system, and by applying the templates in a consistent manner. Writing good content The success or failure of the website, in terms of getting people to understand what LCC need them to, will depend on writing good content for the website. Some of the key principles of writing good content are: Keep it short, simple and to the point Shorter words and sentences are easier to understand. Avoid large chunks of unbroken text. Break content down into its briefest amount. A usability study by Nielsen shows that usability can be improved by 58% just by cutting half of the words on a webpage (Nielsen, 1997; How Users Read on the Web). Put the point of the article at the beginning Eye-tracking studies have shown that users read in chunks and tend to lose focus as they read down the page (Nielsen, 2006; F-Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content). People often want to get a fact or a piece of information, make this easy to scan for. Don't assume any previous knowledge Explain clearly the item so that it make sense to a reader with little or no background information. This may be the first page they see. Be consistent, not uniform Use the same language and design patterns throughout. Every page can be unique, but use the same conventions for where things like \"further reading\" and \"related information\" etc. are placed. Next: Search"

There are still some elements that are important to bear in mind when writing content to ensure that it appears in search appropriately. These considerations are: Write short, informative titles that make sense when viewed out of context of the page itself. Avoid having multiple items with near identical titles that when they will appear as search results might be difficult to differentiate. (Nielsen, 2009; World's Best Headlines: BBC News). Attach a full set of metadata to every item. Ensure that all the metadata fields are completed at the time of content creation, as these are the mechanisms that the search tool uses in order to return results. Next: Navigation"
