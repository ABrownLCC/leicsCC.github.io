We’re designing and building digital products, platforms and content to help the council make the most of digital technology as an enabler for better, smarter and more efficient services.

To do this we:
-   start with user needs to make sure we’re solving real problems
-   work in an agile way – being open, transparent and iterating quickly
-   test our assumptions by putting things in front of real people as early as possible

This allows us to learn what works and what doesn’t, and what to do next to meet the user need.

Being user focussed doesn’t mean that we only think about the customer. We have to balance this view with the council’s goals to ensure that digital services help to meet the needs of our colleague’s on the front line. It means identifying the business objective behind each task – it might be to help someone, signpost to other sources of help, or it might be to encourage a change of behaviour.

A mix of roles makes up the multi-disciplinary team:

**Content design** – more than just words, this role is about exploring the quickest, easiest, simplest way to allow a user to do what they need to do. An iterative process, designers work with subject matter experts who understand the topic deeply, to help present and explain it clearly.

**User experience** – as people expect more and more of online services, the value of user experience is in doing the hard work to make things simple, easy and straight-forward. Research, insight, testing and design patterns are all tools used to develop good user journeys and experiences online.

**Development** – pixels and code are the materials of the web, so our development work is responsible for making sure our services are robust, accessible and reliable. A number of platforms and frameworks are in that underpin our online experiences. We try and use open source, because it’s more extensible, flexible and generally better most of the time.
