Search will automatically index all pages on the site. There are still some elements that are important to bear in mind when writing content to ensure that it appears in search appropriately.

These considerations are:

-   Write short, informative titles that make sense when viewed out of context of the page itself. Avoid having multiple items with near identical titles that when they will appear as search results might be difficult to differentiate. (Nielsen, 2009; [World&#39;s Best Headlines: BBC News](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/worlds-best-headlines-bbc-news/)).
-   Attach a full set of metadata to every item. Ensure that all the metadata fields are completed at the time of content creation, as these are the mechanisms that the search tool uses in order to return results.
